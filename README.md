This code first generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the Random class. 
Then it enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter their guess, increments the guess count, 
and checks if the user's guess is equal to the computer's number. If the user's guess is too low 
or too high, it tells them so and prompts them for another guess. If the user's guess is correct, 
it congratulates them and tells them how many guesses it took. If the user hasn't guessed the number in 6 guesses, 
it tells them they lose and reveals the number.

Note that this code uses the Scanner class to read input from the user, 
and it closes the Scanner object at the end to release any resources it is using.
